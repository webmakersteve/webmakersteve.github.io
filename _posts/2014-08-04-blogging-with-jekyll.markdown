Well, I finally did it. I finally submitted to learning Ruby. And why? Because of Jekyll.

No, not because I need to know Ruby to use Jekyll, because I don't. Jekyll is so easy to use because it's just a matter of using liquid templates, which are like some hybrid of smarty and handlebars and very easy. More because Jekyll is so well put together and awesome that the language it's written in must have at least some level of awesome. And... it's time to learn another language.

While my heart will always belong to Node.js, let's see where this Ruby adventure takes me. The only thing I do know is that PHP better implement a package manager ala ```npm```, ```gem```, ```cabal```, or any other self-respecting language's "universal" package manager. I mean come on, even Microsoft has NuGet. 

I know, Composer. You're crying a little bit but you just aren't where you need to be to compete with these heavy-weight champions in the ring. I mean, Twitter even used Node.js to make a front-end package manager and we can't get any package manager love?!

Well, that's the end of today's rant.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
# Why is Tom being used so often lately?
# I mean I just did email templates
# and Tom was their name of choice, too.
{% endhighlight %}

If you're looking to see what all the buzz is about, seriously check it out. Jekyll is so easy to use and you get that beautifully static speed, and... wait for it... **free** hosting. That's right. *free*. If you just push your code to GitHub it will build it from source and you don't need to pay a dime, even with a custom domain.

So if you're looking to start with Jekyll, you can read some more information about it. Here's an excerpt from the original Jekyll post:
