So, the new episode of the Legend of Korra came out today. And it was pretty awesome. But no spoilers today!

I was especially happy because it came out at 7:00AM. I bought the season Google Play, so Google now alerts me every time there is a new episode posted. I got the alert at 7 in the morning and had something to wake me up before work. I watched the entire thing two times already. Now, this one isn't as good as the last one was, in my opinion (yes, that's right, opinion not preference), but it was still a great addition nonetheless.

I'm not going to give any spoilers on the episode because I would hate anyone who did that to me if I hadn't seen it -- although no one would ever have the chance. I just wanted to talk about the show in general because anyone not watching it should be.

I brought my Chromecast to the office yesterday expecting to be able to use it only to play some music. I started off with something light - Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix. After playing the entire remastered Mono Masters album by the Beatles I opened the next decision to democracy. I asked if anyone had any requests, and to my surprise everyone suggested that I stop playing music and put some visual media on.

Well, I jumped at this opportunity to evangelize the office to the greatness of Avatar: the Last Airbender. Of course when I said I was putting Avatar on the entire office thought I was talking about those blue creatures from that *other* Avatar movie. Then, they thought I was talking about the M. Night Shyamalan movie. After rejecting both of these claims they had no idea what I was talking about so I put it on hoping they would enjoy it as much as I do.

I chose season 2 episode 7, not because it was a good one for them to see first but just because that's where I was on my eleventh iteration of the season. Zuko Alone is one of my personal favorites, especially considering the events of the next episode.

Well, no one liked it. But who would with the negative reinforcement imposed by working for demanding clients? I mean, who can't appreciate dialogue like this:

> You must never give into despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength. - Iroh

There's just so much wisdom packed into that show, and Korra isn't an exception. While there isn't a single wise character in the show who really guides the theme of virtue through words, there is wisdom to be found in the Legend of Korra through the plot. I'm really trying not to give any spoilers at all, so you'll need to watch.

It's a worthwhile show and *apparently* its ratings are suffering. So help remedy this and watch the show! You won't be disappointed. Just don't do it at work.
