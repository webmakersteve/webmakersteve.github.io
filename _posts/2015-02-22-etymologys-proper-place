Language itself is an interesting subject about which to have discourse. There is no doubt that language is a human construct with a certain end, but the control we as human beings ought to have over it after we conceive and nurture it is somewhat up to debate.

##Fire

Language is like fire. Fire is a natural construct which helps bring life (in its form of the sun) to all creatures. Fire is a natural occurence that would retain its importance regardless of how it is being used by the rational beings of a given world. However, fire was repurposed by rational creatures into something which, while fit toward its original end, is not that end itself. We learned how to cause fire to be created in a given space, even if we do not create or control it ourselves. We can create camping fires to help us cook our food, which makes it safer to eat and tastier; we can use fire to generate electricity for all manner of other devices; and this only touches the tip of the iceberg.

So, a debate comes up about artificial vs. natural purpose. Naturally occurring events in natural generally correspond to natural purpose. Human beings have the construct of reason, which allows abstract thinking and separation of effects and causes. Reason allows us to transcend the purely causal system of action-reaction and make it our own. 

What's an example of this? Well, let's look at fire again quickly. We could have potentially seen fire caused by a bolt of lightning from the sky. The lightning came down from clouds while it was raining and struck the highest of the trees in the area, catching it on fire. The fire burned the tree and turned it into ash, but while this burning was happening, light and heat emanated from the place of the strike. We obviously can ascertain the action-reaction relationship here when we say bold of lightning hitting tree = fire. But our reason doesn't stop here.

Each element in the equation posesses often times unique qualities. This interaction of unique qualities causes a reaction to happen. These qualities exist within substance creating its substance, but can be found apart from the particular substance we perceive them in originally. For example, the attribute of `hot` may exist within other substances, like `desert`. 

In looking at the causal relationship we abstract away these attributes from their correspondent substances to learn the real nature of the reaction we see. It is not merely in its reacting parts, and these attributes can be found elsewhere. We can learn that this lightning relationship with the tree is introducting an  `hot` substance with a `dry` tree. 

We can then replicate the event by introducting two different `hot` and `dry` agents to get the effect we're looking for, and thus the human capacity for science, closely dependent on this process of abstraction, is born.

## The Nature of Language

With that having been said, it is time we moved on to the subject of our discussion, language itself. At its core, language is a means to transmit ideas between two rational beings. This differs from communication, which seeks to transmit messages between two rational beings. While language is a means to communication, not all communication happens through language.

Just to extrapolate on this quickly, take the following example:

```
Birds communicate incoming danger by squawking in a particular manner. Other birds in the area know, when this type of squawk is transmitted, that there is a dangerous predator and it is time to fly away.
```

Communication generally relies on a 1:1 translation because it means to transmit messages. These 1:1 relationships are available to the two common communicators, which makes the communication work. We introduce signifciant additional overhead in using a language, which relies on symbols. This is because symbols do not have a 1:1 relationship, as they depend on the common definitions between the two agents of the communicated language. I'm sure when you say `home` and I say `home` we approach the same object but may mean it in different senses. This additional complexity causes language as a construct to have both *reference* and *sense*.

**Reference**: The real-life reference of a particular symbol (e.g. word, image).    
**Sense**: the particular way in which a word refers to its reference.

If we were programmers, communication would be analogous to a transmission protocol, like TCP, while Language is an implementation of TCP like HTTP. HTTP gives meaning to TCP communication by creating convention and structure, like sense and reference.

Communication is a natural construct in nature, as we have found, with low level, clear and distinct meanings. As language is an implementation of such a construct, it participates in it and inherits some of its attributes and qualities. And in this fashion can we come up with the true nature of language.

#### Teleology

When looking to understand something, teleology is always a useful mode to start with. The implementation of symbolic language is meant to do a certain thing, and it's probably pretty available to most people who use it. Language is intended to convey an idea from one person to another. This meaning has a referent and a sense, and our job as communicators is to try to bring the same senses and references to the discussion in the mind of a subjective person.

And what a difficult task this proves to be time and time again. How often do we find that arguments are caused over "misunderstandings" or "jumps to conclusions"? The root of these problems is that the reference is synonymous but the sense differs between people. This *imprecision* can lead to so many communication problems and obligates the good communicator to understand factors about his audience before he chooses a particular word. 

This disparity between what we mean, and what the person thinks we mean is a fundamental problem in the end of language. We want this disparity to be as small as possible to give us the greatest chance of success. 

So when all is said and done, pun intended, we ought to keep this disparity as low as possible if we wish to succeed as speakers.

#### Vocabulary

Vocabulary is an engine by which we distinguish senses and references with the highest precision possible. In order to normalize the playing field between varied interlocutors, sets of vocabulary are instituted so we all have a common rule book. 

I'm sure it is sometimes irritating that words like `ostentatious` exist, and people often criticize the speaker for using wierd vocabulary, but the truth of the matter is that these varied words exist to satisfy this natural problem in language.

We have words like house, home, abode, lodging, and apartment. I'm sure when you look at these words you will see distinct differences between what images arise. I'm so sure about this because Googling these words yields different results, and results we would more often than not agree on. This distinctions are crucial to any language's success.

There is, however, one word in the list that sticks out more than the others, and that is the word *home*. Home is the most subjective word in the list because its reference can itself be subjective. This is a word where we agree more on the sense in which it is used than the reference it points to. When we think of home, we generally think of our own homes - where we were brought up, where we live, or where we're happy. In fact, Billy Joel sings about this in one of his songs, *You're My Home*:

>Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike  
Indiana's early morning dew.
Way up in the hills of California
Home is just another word for you

The subjectivity of this word makes its use inadvisible in clear conversation, but as the person with whom you speak approaches closer to you in common experience, its use becomes more acceptable. Consider the question, "When are you coming home tonight?" As someone who alternates between D.C. and New York, the person who asks this question contributes a lot to the response they will get. If Rosanna, who lives in D.C. asks, it may mean to ask when I am going back to D.C. If my mother asks, it may be New York instead. This is because our common homes, i.e. the common homes between me and either of these two people, differ in their reference, and thus distinguish themselves subjectively.

This problem of language of requiring such a varied amount of context is an ongoing one, but as long as your communications meet their end it is largely irrelevant practically.

## What happened to fire?

If you weren't wondering what the fire discussion had to do with language, I would be either disappointed or impressed. I meant to call attention to a natural construct that is used in unnatural ways to help make life as a thinking thing better.

As we saw, language is based on the very basic mechanism called communication. Such a mechanism is so basic that even single-celled organisms do it. It potentializes multi-cellular organisms by allowing varied and many substances to work together to a common goal. 

But we do more than communicate messages - we communicate ideas. This communication, as we have seen, is very complicated, even if we understand its purpose. We saw the problem of certain vocabulary, but I would argue that more words than you would think fit into this problem category of language. Consider the following  cultural issues:

1. Gender
2. Bill Clinton's definition of *is*
3. Equal Pay for Women

These all contain words that we would think are more solid than they actually are in modern culture. Let's start with gender. Within even my lifetime the word gender has undergone transformation. It used to be a dichotomy of male and female, but some argue that there are more genders than just two. Gender used to be synonymous with *sex*, but now sex and gender are separate and not always synonymous concepts. This transformation was due to the LGBT movement, which earlier in my life was not as strong moving but has now been gaining momentum.

This change is okay. There is no way around it and the LGBT movement is actually referencing a fundamental problem. They are correct in their determination that there is something, call it *x*, which references a person's self-sexual identity and is not so one dimensional that it can be described within a two-choice dichotomy. We need a word to help us describe our identification within this to other people. The word *gender* was used in making this determination, so it seems that *gender* would be best suited as the word to modify.

The logic is sound for anyone who believes that changing words based on cultural shifts is acceptable. Anyone who believes it was okay for us to identify unions performed by the government  (heterosexual or not) as marriages, but is not okay with the change of the word gender is committing, in my opinion, a contradiction. 

The next one on the list is Bill Clinton's famous "definition of the word *is*". This is a particularly funny one because nearly all communication depends on the parity of the word *is*. But, I bet a lot of people don't really know what the word *is* means; this is cause for reflection.

The word *is* is a linking word that can be used a few different ways. There is the 'is' of attribution and the 'is' of predication. We can use 'is' to identify an attribute of a given object but not identify it in this way by equivalence. We use this one frequently, like when we say "this food is delicious." We are obviously not saying that `delicious` is the same is `this food`, but we are making a meaningful judgment.

We can also use the word is to identify a substance in a particular way. This happens when we say "my name is Stephen." `my name` is logically equivalent to `Stephen`.

The last on the list is Equal Pay for Women. Equality is an important word because it is fundamental to all judgments. To judge a thing a certain way, you are judging it to be something and not something else. In this manner, it is equal to something, and unequal to something else. Plato uses the word "equal" in the Phaedo as the principle of non-contradiction made manifest. The PNC (principle of non-contradiction) is one of if not the most fundamental law in reason.

It is interesting to think that we may have varied definitions on something so fundamental to our entire thinking life. And maybe you, the reader, believe there is no equivocation in this word. However, proponents and opponents of this law are likely to disagree on what constitutes equal.

For a proponent of the law, equal may be a more statistical equal. Women ought to be paid around the same, on average, as men. For an opponent, perhaps women and men should be paid the same amount on a specific case-by-case basis, but such equality cannot be properly generalized and ascertained by national statistics.

So even here, equal is used to reference the same thing but each holds a different sense.

## The Far-Fetched Conclusion

This brings us to the end of our adventure in this fascinating human construct, so it's time to wrap it together.

When humans investigated fire, we made something new from the natural but only in building upon what was already there. We did not seek to alter the original qualities of fire, but rather utilize them to the maximum potential in varied ends. Likewise, the construct of language should seek to approach its communication base as closely as possible, and seek a one-to-one correspondence to the fullest extent. Language's complexity consequently does not allow the limit to be equal to full correspondence, but to use language to the best of its ability we should actively pursue ways of approaching this goal.

In my own experience, the best way to have common fundamentals is to have common fundamentals. This is a fascinating seeming-tautology, but I mean each of these 'common fundamentals' as different referents. 

The first common fundamentals refers to something to replace field of experience in our basis for language value judgments. Field of experience is great, but is always so different on a case by case basis and cannot be relied upon. What can be relied upon, however, is the past. Etymology seeks to understand the words being used in the perspective of the way they have been historically used. It makes no judgments about whether the words should be consistent in meaning, but it does record and explicate their meanings.

But you can make those judgments. If you and I both use etymology to define the words we use even on a colloquial basis, we can help the parity of ideas not only insofar as they are communicated but also as they are thought in our own minds. The first step to making progress together intellectually is to be able to communicate as efficiently and effectively as possible, and such a communication deserves a real common ground.

So go open up an etymological dictionary or learn ancient Greek or Latin. Learn where your words come from and try to maintain their meanings as you go along in life. Otherwise, you'll be trying to use fire as shampoo, and sometimes its better to just follow the example of nature in our own interactions. Nature is unyielding, and if you don't want to spend the energy to try to overcome her at every corner, it is better to not try to make her something she isn't.
