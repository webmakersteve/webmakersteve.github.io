So, I was reading [MMOC][mmoc] today and saw something amazing. No, it wasn't the loss of a few hundred thousands of subscribers.

It was the WoW 10th Anniversary post. I'm going to assume you didn't know the clinger there from reading the title. Yes, I am that ignorant.

So anyway, they're doing some really exciting stuff for this anniversary that puts the event on par with the WoTLK pre-release event. I mean, I can't be certain it will be better but I am excited enough that I think it will be.

## Southshore vs. Tarren Mill

Yes. You heard it right. They are bringing back the good old days of Southshore vs. Tarren Mill. You know, the first battleground in WoW, albeit unofficial battleground. Yes, the best and brightest WoW had to offer gathered there looking for opponents of equal skill and level to fight to the death in honorable battle. Oh wait, no they didn't. It wasn absolute gank-fest of level 60 Horde and Alliance congregating to lay waste to the opposing town and slaughter all the fresh level 20-30 players who were not yet used to having PvP flags forced on (at least on PvP servers). Some bright-eyed gnome full of wonder and excitement of what awaited him got off the gryphon and walked north out of Southshore. He saw a bunch of races he didn't recognize on his side, like Orcs and Tauren. He /waved. "Hello!" he thought to himself. He paid no mind to the skull on their nameplate. All of the Horde players began to drool with blood-lust. As he walked closer each player chose his fastest-casting spell or attack and executed it, just to watch the poor guy taste the ground faster than he could say lag.

Ahh, the good old days. No seriously. It was awesome. Southshore vs. Tarren Mill was like a father to us. He taught us like a High School bully. Having tons of unfair advantages he kicked us and told us we were worthless. We woefully accepted his painful words, but rose with new vigor. We had a new purpose - to continue this endless fraternity-like institution and beat the opponents' low level players into a pulp so we could pass on our tradition of youthful insecurity.

But it also taught us to help our friends. Usually you filtered it out when some low level guildmate said "gaiz can u help me plz i keep getting ganked." But if that guy made sure to include that he was in Hillsbrad, people rushed to the rescue seeing a chance for a 100 on 100 deathmatch that would never end. I mean, who didn't get 90% of his honor points from Southshore WPvP?

>If you engaged in PvP early on in WoW, you might have fond memories of and perhaps a few scars from the endless tug-of-war between Horde and Alliance players at Tarren Mill and Southshore. To recapture that feeling, we ll be opening a Team Deathmatch style Battleground based on that timeless struggle. However, unlike the old days of Tarren Mill vs. Southshore, there will be a clearly defined victor, so you ll need to work as a team or face crushing defeat.

The best PvP I ever participated in was in those areas. I remember the bad times of leveling in that Wendigo cave in the north just to glance over the ledge and see some red text. Then, feeling a combination of dread and excitement, one of which would dissipate after I discovered his level. If he was equal, we would battle and my heart would race. If he was higher level I would just sit on the floor and await my inevitable demise.

So, as you can probably tell, I read this and a new found excitement for life arose in me. But then I kept reading...

## Molten Core

Woah! No way! **The** Molten Core? Being remade? I mean I know it's raid finder but it's still super exciting. Molten Core composed the "hardcore-ness" of my raiding career in vanilla.

>Molten Core provided many WoW players with their first taste of WoW raiding. For the anniversary celebration, max-level players will be able to participate in a special 40-player Raid Finder version to relive the experience of hunting down Ragnaros and his minions within his fiery lair. Downing the Firelord will earn you an Achievement and a special Core Hound mount reward (fireproof leg armor not included).

I remember being a fresh level 60 whispering some raiding guilds saying "I'll go!" Then, to my despair, **attunement was required**. Why wouldn't it be? But I still whispered guild after guild asking them if attunement was required so I could piggy back into their lagfest and compete with 40 other people for loot. Eventually I gave up on finding the benificent guild willing to take one useless cog in the greater clock of raiding through an entire dungeon just so he could get to the instance portal without doing the quest. I did the quest and was ready to go! Got into a guild and went to Molten Core the same day, not knowing what this new world of raiding would hold for me.

I was a healer, and the experience was roughly equivalent to watching Twitch Plays Pokemon. There were quite a few of us all healing basically two targets that went low on health, kind of fighting to get yours in first by being sly and healing him while he was full to anticipate that next attack. Then, when you succeeded sniping all of his health and leeching all of the innervates, you could link the healing meters with pride knowing you were the *best*.

Well Blizzard, in their all-knowing wisdom, wanted to simulate this *exact* experience I just described and realized they already had an engine by which they could accomplish this. It's called Raid Finder. Obviously originating from the 40-man MC raids when it wasn't current content, Raid Finder is a way to get 25 strangers together and try to accomplish a goal which inevitably happens due to pure random chance. Have I mentioned Twitch Plays Pokemon?

So in Raid Finder you get your Pigeot to level 85 and then one shot all of the Elite 4's... oh wait, wrong thing.

So in Raid Finder you work with these other people to get some watered down loot. It's sometimes fun if you make it not about the gameplay. Otherwise, I hate it. But Blizzard is one-upping the idea of 25 random strangers of skill levels all over the spectrum (generally on the lower end of the bell curve, though) and making it 40 people! Never before have 40 people of incredibly low video gaming skill congregated for a single cause. Let's hope there aren't any difficult mechanics.

Oh wait, there weren't any in MC. I hope they like decursing. Back then we had Decursive, and it was my job to just keep clicking a little window on my screen and I was praised as a hero.

But in all seriousness, I am also very excited about this feature. It's going to be awesome to go back to old content, get some revamped versions of the gear, and experience it in Warlords.

## Fire Corgis

This is pretty self-explanatory. It's basically a pet Corgis that is set aflame. It's also unbearably cute and I want one and luckily it is within my skill level to get one, maybe. You need to log in during the event.

This was a very ranty rant, so I hope it was bearable. In case you missed what I said, it's right above you. In case large amounts of text scare you, look below.

### TL;DR:

In case that was too much text for you, please feel free to see this summary of what I said
