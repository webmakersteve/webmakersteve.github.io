Thanks for stumbling across my blog. My name is Stephen and I specialize in the web. No way you would have been able to figure that one out.

I do mostly front end work to support my insatiable addiction to consume quantities of sustinence and give my cells energy so they may sustain life. I have a problem, I know. But I literally couldn't live without food. I would just die, in like a few weeks.

But apart from that I like to tinker with things that will never exist, work on fun solutions to problems that already have less-fun solutions, and play World of Warcraft.
